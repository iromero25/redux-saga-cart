# redux-saga-cart
Checkout cart app using Redux for state management and Sagas to handle several asynchronous database operations. Typescrypt is used as programming language.

## server
ToDo: mention that this app relies on an external server to serve its AJAX requests.

## NPM Registry and Library dependencies
As a reminder, library dependencies were all installed using NPM's public repository using:
`YARN_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmjs.org yarn install`

Also, I am using specifyic verions of `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `typescript`, `ts-loader` and `copy-webpack-plugin` that are not conflictive. More recent versions of these libraries were tried and resulted in many errors being thrown at compile/bundle time.
